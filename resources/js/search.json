[[{"l":"Welcome to the Parsley documentation","p":["Parsley is an easy-to-use reflection-based dependency injection package that fits into any Go application. It bridges the gap between dependency configuration and service activation. Want to know how? Read on."]}],[{"l":"Quick start","p":["This quick start guide walks you through structuring your application and using Parsley to dynamically register and resolve services (or components) at runtime. In this documentation, the terms services and components are used interchangeably but mean the same thing—object instances of a specific type. To effectively understand dependency mapping in Parsley, let's look at a practical example involving types, interfaces, and constructor methods. Once you are familiar with the basics, you can check out the rest of this documentation for more advanced usage and integration examples."]},{"l":"Structuring the application","p":["Inversion of control (IoC) is a design principle that flips your application's traditional approach to handling dependencies. Instead of having components directly instantiate their dependencies, you structure your application so that dependencies are provided to components at the time of their creation. In Parsley, object instances are created through constructor methods, whereby dependencies are expressed as arguments. This approach decouples your components and promotes more flexible and maintainable code.","In the quick start example, we define a DataService interface and provide two implementations for it. The application maps the constructor functions to the abstraction, and resolves all registered services to call their FetchData method in a loop."]},{"l":"Add the Parsley reference","p":["Use the following command to add a reference to the latest version of the Parsley library to your project:"]},{"l":"Define interfaces","p":["Interfaces in Go are a powerful tool for decoupling dependencies and defining contracts between different components of an application or library. While the Go community often emphasizes composition over inheritance and favors concrete types over interfaces in many scenarios, defining interfaces remains viable, particularly when integrating with existing enterprise patterns - such as dependency injection - from other languages.","In the provided example, DataService is an interface that mandates the implementation of the FetchData method, which should return a string. This contract ensures that any implementing DataService will provide a method to fetch data, regardless of how it is internally implemented (e.g., fetching from a remote server, database, or local storage)."]},{"l":"Create implementation types","p":["Implementation types are the concrete structs that fulfill the contracts defined by the interfaces. If combined with constructor functions (whose return type are interfaces), those structs can be kept private."]},{"l":"Define constructor methods","p":["Constructor methods are responsible for creating instances of the implementation types. These methods specify the dependencies required by the implementation type through their parameters. To keep things simple for now, the services in this example are not dependent on other services, thus the constructor functions do not have any parameters."]},{"l":"Configure dependency mapping in Parsley","p":["With the types, interfaces, and constructor methods defined, you can now configure Parsley to map these dependencies. This involves setting up a service registry and registering the services with appropriate lifetimes. The example below registers the remoteDataService and localDataService types as transient services.","Create a service registry: The NewServiceRegistry function initializes a new service registry, which will hold the configuration for all your service mappings.","Register services: Services are registered with the registry using functions such as RegisterTransient, RegisterScoped, RegisterSingleon and others. In this example, we're registering services using the constructor functions NewRemoteDataService and NewLocalDataService with a transient lifetime behavior, causing the resolver to instanciate services each time they are requested."]},{"l":"Resolve dependencies","p":["Finally, services can be resolved via Parsley. This involves using the resolving package to obtain instances of your services as needed. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the process:","Create a Resolver: The NewResolver function initializes a resolver with the provided registry, which contains the configuration for all your service mappings.","Create a context to manage scoped services: The NewScopedContext function creates a new scope context. A scope context defines the lifetime and scope of the services being resolved. Here, we're using the background context from the context package, which is a common way to initialize a root context in Go.","Resolve the required services: The ResolveRequiredServices[T] function is used to retrieve instances of the specified service type ( DataService in this case). This function requires the resolver and scope context as parameters. It returns a list of object instances compatible with the specified type T and an error, allowing you to handle any issues that might occur during the resolution process."]}],[{"l":"Register Constructor Functions","p":["The most basic service registration with Parsely is to provide a constructor function to the registry.","The whole greeter service module is defined as follows: It consists of the Greeter interface functioning as the abstraction for the greeter implementation type. The NewGreeter constructor function is responsible for creating the greeter instance but returns it as a Greeter rather than a *greeter.","It would also be possible for the NewGreeter constructor function to return a *greeter instead. Even though it is not recommended, Parsley will be able to satisfy dependents requiring greeter objects. However, if you need to replace the implementation type, you´ll have to change the receiving constructor functions instead of just changing the NewGreeter constructor function."]}]]
